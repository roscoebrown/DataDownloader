waiting for a call back from IT to get a refreshable csv/xls file to work with. Said you have to buy it on a daily basis which sounded expensive. Otherwise you would have to use the search feature in the Data Center on a daily basis but I know you don’t necessarily want to do it that way. The Data Center has a lot of information that could be automatically pulled and is a good resource on its own.
